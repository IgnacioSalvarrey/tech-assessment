# QA Take-Home Assessment — Plan

**Role:** QA Engineer (manual + automation)
**Timebox for candidate:** 1 day (~6–8h)
**System under test (SUT):** a purpose-built static web app that simulates AceUp flows (AI coach chat + session scheduling)
**Candidate output:** a bug/UX report **plus** a Cypress suite
**Scoping decisions (locked):** Cypress required · static site only (no backend) · seeded/deterministic bug injection · 1-day timebox

---

## 1. Why this shape

We need to measure two distinct skills that a "write some tests" homework can't separate:

1. **Exploratory testing judgment** — can they find real defects in an unfamiliar UI, tell a functional bug from a UX smell, and write a report a dev can act on without a follow-up call?
2. **Automation engineering** — can they turn findings into a maintainable, deterministic Cypress suite (selectors, waits, fixtures, no sleeps, no flake)?

A **static app with intentionally injected defects** gives us a known ground truth (we know exactly what's broken), so grading is objective — unlike "test our real app," where recall is unmeasurable.

**Determinism decision:** bugs are gated by a **seed** in the URL (`?seed=7391`), not by `Math.random()`. Same seed ⇒ same behaviour, always. Each candidate gets a **personal seed**, so a shared "answer key" between candidates doesn't transfer, while every run of *their* seed is reproducible (and so is our re-run when grading). A purely random app is untestable and unfair to grade.

## 2. Deliverable structure (what we build)

```

Plus `README.md` (internal index + how to bundle/send) and `seeds.example.md` (candidate →
seed register template; the real `seeds.md` stays out of git).

**Distribution:** candidate receives `app/` + `homework/` only (zip or a separate throwaway repo). `homework-evaluation/` never leaves us.

**Anti-lookup measure:** defect flags are named opaquely (`fx_a1`) and the injection logic lives inline with normal code — reading the source is *allowed* (real QA reads code) but it doesn't hand them a labelled bug list, and the report is still graded on **repro steps + expected/actual**, which requires actually driving the app.

## 3. The SUT — product simulation

Domain-faithful to AceUp, ~5 screens, zero framework, servable with `npx serve` or `python3 -m http.server`.

| Screen | Interactions | Why it's here |
|---|---|---|
| **Dashboard** | next session card, upcoming count, "Book a session" CTA, toast area | cross-screen data consistency (counts vs reality) |
| **Coach directory** | search, filter by specialty/language, sort, pagination | classic filter+pagination state bugs |
| **Booking** | pick coach → date → slot grid → duration (30/60) → notes → confirm modal | the richest bug surface: timezones, double-book, optimistic UI |
| **My sessions** | list, reschedule, cancel, status badges | state transitions + destructive actions |
| **AI coach chat** | text input, send, fake streaming reply, typing indicator, "regenerate", error path | async UI, race conditions, empty input, long text |

Fake API characteristics (all seed-driven, all documented in `bug-catalog.md`):
- latency 200–900ms so **waits actually matter** (candidates who use `cy.wait(3000)` get caught)
- deterministic failure injection on a specific request N of an endpoint, not random (booking attempt #4, chat message #3)
- state persisted to `localStorage` so **test isolation matters** (a suite that doesn't reset state will fail on second run — a deliberate flakiness trap)

---

## 4. Defect catalogue (design)

Two tiers. **Tier A is always on** for every seed (baseline recall — everyone must find these). **Tier B is seed-selected**, 3 of 6 per candidate (differentiates thoroughness, kills answer sharing).

### Tier A — always on (functional, must-find)

| ID | Defect | Severity | Detectable by |
|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | **Timezone drift** — slot rendered in the coach's TZ, persisted as UTC ⇒ "My sessions" and the dashboard show a different hour than the slot clicked and confirmed | Critical | booking with a non-UTC coach, comparing 3 screens |
| A2 | **Double booking** — Confirm button not disabled during the in-flight request; two fast clicks create two sessions on one slot | High | rapid clicks / no loading state |
| A3 | **Cancel doesn't free the slot** — cancelled session's slot stays `unavailable` in the grid | High | cancel → return to booking |
| A4 | **Empty message accepted** — whitespace-only chat message renders a bubble and triggers a reply | Medium | chat with `"   "` |
| A5 | **Silent truncation** — session notes > 280 chars saved truncated with no warning or counter | Medium | long-text boundary testing |

### Tier B — seed-selected (3 of 6)

| ID | Defect | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| B1 | **Filter lost on pagination** — page count is computed from the unfiltered list, so "3 coaches found" still offers "Page 1 of 3" and page 2 lists non-matching coaches | High |
| B2 | **Reschedule resets duration** — a 60-min session becomes 30 min after reschedule, silently | High |
| B3 | **False success toast** — the injected 500 on the 4th booking attempt still shows "Session booked!" and no session is created | Critical |
| B4 | **Typing indicator never clears** on a failed chat reply; input stays disabled ⇒ dead-end state | High |
| B5 | **Invalid email accepted** in "invite a guest" (`a@b`, trailing dot, spaces) | Medium |
| B6 | **Stale dashboard count** — "Upcoming sessions" doesn't decrement after cancel until a hard reload | Medium |

### UX / accessibility issues — report-only, not automated

Deliberately *not* functional bugs, to test whether they can tell the difference and prioritize:

- Destructive **Cancel session** has **no confirmation** and no undo
- Toast auto-dismisses in **1.2s** — unreadable, and the only place errors surface
- Slot tiles are `<div onclick>` — **not keyboard reachable**, no focus ring, no `aria-pressed`
- Modal has **no focus trap**, doesn't close on `Escape`, background scrolls
- Chat input has **no label**, send button is an unlabelled icon (no accessible name)
- **Contrast failures** on disabled slots and helper text (below 4.5:1)
- **Inconsistent date formats** (`MM/DD/YYYY` on dashboard vs `DD/MM/YYYY` on sessions) — ambiguity, ties to A1
- No **empty state** for "no coaches match your filters" (just a blank area)
- No **loading state** anywhere (ties to A2)
- At 320px width: **horizontal overflow**, tap targets < 44px
- Timezone never displayed next to a time anywhere (root-cause hint for A1)

Grading intent: a strong candidate reports **A1 as Critical with the timezone/date-format inconsistency as suspected root cause**, and files the a11y items separately as UX debt rather than padding the bug count.

## 5. Candidate assignment (outline of `homework/assignment.md`)

**Part 1 — Exploratory testing & reporting (~3h)**
1. Charter-based exploration of the 5 flows with their personal seed.
2. `BUG_REPORT.md`: one entry per defect — ID, title, severity + **priority with justification**, environment, preconditions, numbered repro steps, expected vs actual, evidence (screenshot/gif/console), suspected area. Duplicates and "works as designed" noise cost points.
3. `UX_FINDINGS.md`: UX/a11y observations, separated from functional bugs, each with user impact and a suggested fix.
4. A short **risk assessment**: which 3 areas they'd regression-test first and why.

**Part 2 — Automation (~3–4h)**
5. Extend `homework/starter/` into a **Cypress** suite: **6–10 specs max** (we explicitly cap it — we want prioritization, not volume).
   - at least 2 specs that **fail** because they assert the *correct* expected behaviour (regression tests for found bugs — must be clearly marked, not skipped)
   - at least 3 **happy-path** specs that pass reliably
   - one **negative/edge** case (validation or error path)
6. Requirements: no `cy.wait(<ms>)` as a sync mechanism; deterministic state reset between specs; no interdependent test order; readable selectors (and a note on where the app forced them into brittle selectors — a real signal we want).
7. `TEST_PLAN.md` (1 page): scope, what they automated vs left manual **and why**, how they made the suite deterministic, what they'd add with more time.

**Explicit non-goals:** no fixing the app, no performance/load testing, no CI required (bonus only), no framework rewrite, no 100% coverage.

**Submission:** repo/zip with `BUG_REPORT.md`, `UX_FINDINGS.md`, `TEST_PLAN.md`, the Cypress suite, and a README with the exact run commands + their seed. Optional 5-min Loom.

## 6. Rubric (outline of `homework-evaluation/criteria.md`)

| # | Area | Weight |
|--:|---|--:|
| 1 | Defect recall & accuracy (vs `bug-catalog.md`, Tier A + their Tier B) | 20% |
| 2 | Bug report quality (reproducibility, expected/actual, evidence, no noise) | 15% |
| 3 | Severity/priority judgment & risk reasoning | 10% |
| 4 | UX & a11y findings (depth, user impact, correctly separated from bugs) | 15% |
| 5 | Cypress suite design (structure, selectors, commands, fixtures, isolation) | 15% |
| 6 | Assertion quality (asserts behaviour/state, not just "element exists") | 10% |
| 7 | Determinism & flake control (no fixed sleeps, clean state, passes 3× in a row) | 10% |
| 8 | Communication (`TEST_PLAN.md`, trade-offs, honest gaps) | 5% |

Scoring: 0–4 bands per area (4 = senior signal, 3 = hire, 2 = shallow, 1 = poor, 0 = absent).

**Objective checks we run:** suite executed **3 consecutive times** (flake detection), recall computed as `found / (5 Tier A + 3 seeded Tier B)`, and `grep` for `cy.wait(` with a numeric arg.

**Bonus:** caught a defect we didn't inject · proposed `data-testid`/a11y fixes to make the app testable · CI workflow · a11y automation (axe) · boundary/negative cases beyond the brief · noticed the localStorage isolation trap and handled it explicitly.

**Red flags:** report with no repro steps · severity everything-is-critical · regression tests written to assert the *buggy* behaviour (locks in the bug) · `cy.wait(5000)` everywhere · order-dependent specs · suite that passes only on a fresh browser profile · bug count padded with duplicates · UX opinions with no user impact.

## 7. Build order (our work)

1. ✅ `app/` — 5 pages, styling, fake API + seed/PRNG
2. ✅ Tier A + Tier B injected behind opaque flags; seed→Tier B mapping computed and verified
3. ✅ `homework-evaluation/bug-catalog.md` — exact repro, code pointers, distractor list
4. ✅ `homework/starter/` Cypress scaffold + passing smoke spec (`cy.visitApp`, `retries: 0`)
5. ✅ `homework/assignment.md`, `criteria.md`, `scorecard.md`, internal `README.md`
6. ✅ **Automated verification of the API layer** — `homework-evaluation/reference/logic-harness.mjs`
   (plain `node`, 24/24 checks on seeds 1000 + 1234): A1, A3, A5, B2, B5, B6, the failure
   injection, slot seeding, and correct behaviour when a flag is *off*
7. ✅ **Zero-install delivery** — `Makefile` + `docker-compose.yml` (nginx on :4173 +
   `cypress/included:15.8.1`) and `START-HERE.md`. Docker is the only prerequisite:
   `make start`, `make test`, `make stop`
8. ✅ **Browser verification of the UI layer** — `reference/verify.internal.cy.js` run through
   Docker: **11/11 on seed 1000 and on seed 1234**, so all 5 Tier A + all 6 Tier B defects are
   confirmed end-to-end. Only the UX/a11y list still needs a human pass
9. ⏳ Dogfood: a timed solo pass to confirm 1 day is realistic and every defect is discoverable
   through the UI alone

## 8. Open questions

- Do we hand this out as a **zip** or a private GitHub repo per candidate (repo makes seed assignment + PR-style submission easier)?
- Should the a11y items be **hinted at** in the assignment ("include accessibility observations") or left unprompted (harder, better signal)? Current draft: prompted, since 1 day is tight.
- Personal seeds: keep an internal `seeds.md` mapping candidate → seed → Tier B set
  (template committed as `seeds.example.md`).
- Do we want a JD (`jd.md`) alongside this, as the devops assessment has, to anchor the
  rubric weights to a published role description?
